    A seated shot highlights G -Tag season-defining camouflage, offering the viewer a closer look at Matthew M. Williams’ 
    intricate hybridization of denim with the Japanese boro “tattered and repaired” technique, reconstructed into trousers. 
    Slipped under a short, tailored jacket, a downy goose feather gilet, crafted by hand on a 4G-grid base, illustrates the savoir-faire in the Givenchy men’s atelier. 
    Elegance as an expression of individuality. Sartorialism as a gesture of nonconformity. A free-spirited sophistication. 
    For the Spring Summer 2024 Menswear show, Givenchy examines the relationship between a new culture of masculine dressing and the codes of the classic gentleman’s wardrobe.
    Drawing on his own generational experience, Artistic Director Matthew M. Williams observes in the spirit of the times a re-contextualisation of the archetypes of smartness:
    a reset perception of the well-tailored silhouette devoid of the preordained virtues of the past.
    The premise prompts a study of our formative discovery of elegance embodied by the school uniform. 
    A dual symbol of democracy and constraint, it is the canvas for teenage-driven customisation: 
    an archetype instinctively re-appropriated according to functionality and personality. Crested knits, sweatshirts and polos shrunken, 
    scoop-necked or cropped at the hip play with ideas of outgrown proportions and self-adaptation, framed by formidable overcoats. 
    Outlining a new formality, schoolboy suits are worn under tech jackets created with heightened savoir-faire, 
    from archival floral embroideries to hand-encrusted crystals and a yellow and black construction crafted entirely in super-light calfskin.

    Givenchy proudly reveals key advertising images for its Fall Winter 2023 women’s wear collection conceived by 
    Creative Director Matthew M. Williams and captured by the photographer Heji Shin.
    The Fall Winter 2023 global campaign draws its inspiration from the golden era of Couture, in the 1950s and 1960s. 
    In a nod to Givenchy archives from that period, the images offer a striking testament to the Creative Director’s way of taking cues from everywhere – 
    whether from the House archives or from the street — and turning them into a new kind of contemporary glamour.
    Layered expressions composed from luxe baggy sweats, delicate jersey tops, cargo pieces, bondage garments, felpa skirts and kilts further demonstrate a new understanding of elegance.
    One is emblazoned with florals adapted from the archives of Hubert de Givenchy and re-evoked in overdyed lasered nylon. 
    Along with a fish motif, the flower represents a study of imagery – arbitrary or symbolic – that magnetises the contemporary gaze and resonates as glamour. 
    Sourced from the Maison’s archives, the motifs appear in flou expressed in ruched dresses with trains, chainmail dresses, and gowns constructed from bands that twist around the body. 
    Amongst the accents of colour, lavallière dresses in leather or hammered satin retain a balance with the pure.

    The campaign showcases a collection defined by strong tailoring, magnified volumes and sharp constructions designed to be worn with ease.
    
    In one double-page spread, Mona Tougaard wears a sculptural black blazer over an asymmetrical dress in mousseline, 
    an outfit that illustrates the designer’s sophisticated approach to proportion and contrast.
    
    In a single-page image, Karolina Spakowski wears a slash-front silk lavaliere blouse paired with a wool mohair tricotine long black skirt, 
    an ensemble that revisits Givenchy elegance with a modern twist. Other essentials — a trench coat in pale yellow leather —neatly capture the designer’s modern and sophisticated approach to the classics.
    
    Accessories include the Voyou statement bag in a new, easy-to-layer medium size in seasonal hues or metallic finishes; 
    Shark Lock Cowboy boots in aged black calf leather, and satin pink with jewel-like details or lurex green pumps. 
    Jewelry, such as Stitch rings and cuff, the Charm necklace and Daisy earrings, as well gloves and the angular new metal Giv-Cut sunglasses complete the looks.
    The Givenchy Fall Winter 2023 women’s campaign will break online on August 28th and in print starting from September.

    For the Fall Winter 2023 Women’s Collection, Givenchy investigates a generational sophistication through reconsidered classical compositions. 
    Drawing on instincts integral to the Maison, Artistic Director Matthew M. Williams mirrors the principles of elegance founded by Hubert de Givenchy in the dressing culture of 
    the arts-driven community of women that surrounds him today. ​

    The reflection on a new elegance takes shape in a balance between the new and the old: 
    silhouettes, constructions and styling informed by the past but adapted for the present. 
    Defined by magnified volumes, tailoring cuts a strong shoulder with a softly nipped-in waist achieved without constriction. 
    Black coats developed in the haute couture atelier are crafted in satin, tricotine, cashmere or mohair and sculpted with inverted pleats either at the back or with buttons at the waist. 
    Suit jackets structured in the same silhouette appear with sheer underpinnings only, observing a contemporary evocation of a mini dress.​
